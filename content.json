Psychologists believe that it plays a crucial role in delivering implicit messages in our daily communication. However, existing emotion sensing solutions exploring audiovisual clues or psychological sensors embody several inherent limitations such as the availability, reliability and privacy issues. To this end, we design EmoSense, a first-of-its-kind WiFi-based emotion sensing system, to offer a low-cost, robust and transparent service. EmoSense needs to address two consecutive challenges: extracting physical expression from wireless channel data and recovering emotion from the corresponding physical expression. For the former, we present a Fresnel zone based theoretical model depicting the fingerprint on the channel data left by the physical expression. For the latter, we design an efficient data-driven mechanism to recognize emotion from the corresponding fingerprints. We prototyped EmoSense on the commodity WiFi infrastructure and compared it with the main-stream sensor-based approach in the real-world scenario, where its effectiveness has been confirmed. EmoSense only leverages the low-cost and prevalent WiFi infrastructures and thus constitutes a tempting solution for emotion sensing. Video Demo(这是utube的链接,理论上还得挂到国内 en~~细枝末节的工作…难道挂到我的b站号上?)

Previous research mainly focuses on exploring wireless signal fingerprints for this purpose, and several shortcomings need to be addressed first before real-world usage, e.g., demanding a large number of APs or labor-intensive site survey. In this paper, through a systematic empirical study, we first gain in-depth understandings of Bluetooth characteristics, i.e., the impact of various factors such as distance, orientation, and obstacles on the Bluetooth RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator). Then, a novel localization model is built to describe the relationship between RSSI and the device location. On this basis, we present MLDB, an indoor localization scheme that leverages user motions to iteratively shrink the search space to locate the target device. MLDB has been prototyped and evaluated in several real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that MLDB is efficient in terms of localization accuracy, searching time and energy consumption.

Its quality constitutes a critical indicator of people’s health conditions, both mentally and physically. Existing sleep monitoring systems either are obstructive to use or fail to provide adequate coverage. To overcome these shortages, we propose Sleepy, an adaptive and noninvasive sleep monitoring system leveraging channel response in t commercial WiFi devices. Sleepy needs no calibrations or target-dependent training to recognize posture changes during sleep. To achieve that, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based foreground extraction method has been designed to adaptively distinguish motions like rollovers (foreground) from background (stationary postures). We prototype Sleepy and evaluate it in two real environments. In the short-term controlled experiments, Sleepy achieves 95% detection accuracy and 5.8% false negative rate. In the 60-minute real case studies, Sleepy demonstrates strong stability. Considering that Sleepy is compatible with existing WiFi infrastructure, it constitutes a low-cost yet promising solution for sleep monitoring.
